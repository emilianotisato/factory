## Traps

- `docs preflight` never returns an empty `judge[]`: `docs.mjs:1706` pushes the harness line unconditionally, and the fixture gets four (unstruck OPEN-1, harness, no rubric, `on main — create feat/fixture`). A test that needs an unparked `factory run` on the fixture cannot go through the binary; call `cli::run::ensure_branch` and `begin` with a synthetic `docs::Branch` instead.
- `docs log merge 001` on the fixture exits 2 (`no agent-log.md in 001-fixture — nothing to merge into`); a test that wants a 0 has to write an `agent-log.md` first.

## Blockers

### BLOCK-201 — FR-1's "`judge[]` parks the run" rule parks every run, including the fixture's · slice-02 · open

**Happened:** PRD §3 FR-1 says `ask[]` and `judge[]` "go to the cockpit as one question each; a run never starts on an unanswered one", and slice 02 task 3, slice 04 and slice 10 repeat it. But `docs.mjs` has something to judge on every repo: `docs.mjs:1706` pushes the harness line unconditionally, `:1707` the rubric line whenever `docs/ux-rubric.md` is missing, `:1743` the branch line whenever the run starts on the default branch. The slice 01 fixture returns four judge lines (`tests/run.rs::run_on_the_clean_fixture_parks_on_the_judge_lines_then_resumes` lists them); this repo returns three. Built as written, `factory run 001` on a clean fixture creates the run, emits `ask_opened` ASK-1..4 and exits 0 in `waiting-owner` — which contradicts task 3's acceptance ("clean fixture → … `events.jsonl` has `run_started`, stdout lists slices 01 and 02, the branch is `feat/fixture`"), task 5's (`phase = 'starting'`) and slice 03's (`factory run 001` on the fixture builds three slices). Those are proven at lib level with a synthetic `Branch` for now; the binary path cannot reach them without an answer path (slice 04) or a different rule. `/deliver` itself (`SKILL.md:34-35`) judges the `judge[]` lines on its own and stops only for `ask[]`.
**Options:**
1. Only `ask[]` parks. `judge[]` items become informational events (`judge_noted`, or `ask_opened` with `source: judge` that does not block) the cockpit shows but the run does not wait on — the `/deliver` behaviour, with the driver as the judge. Cost: FR-1's sentence changes to "`ask[]` goes to the cockpit as one question each; `judge[]` is logged", one `if` in `src/cli/run.rs`, the fixture test flips to the pass path; slices 03–10 can test against the fixture unchanged.
2. Keep the rule as written. Every run, on every repo, starts with an owner ritual of three or four `factory answer`s; slice 03 cannot test its loop on the fixture until slice 04 lands the answer path, so slices 03 and 04 swap order or 03 tests through `begin` only. Cost: the acceptances of slice 02 task 3, task 5 and slice 03 are rewritten, and the unattended run is no longer unattended at its start.
3. Make `docs.mjs` emit judge lines only when there is something to judge (a harness that disagrees with the QA plan, a rubric the PRD asked for) — outside this repo (feature-docs skill), a PRD-002 of its own; this slice would wait on it.
**Recommended:** 1, because `judge` is already defined by `/deliver` as "the orchestrator decides, the owner is not asked", and the driver is the orchestrator; it keeps slices 03–10 testable on the fixture and the run unattended, and nothing of what was built here changes shape — only the routing of one list.

## Decisions

### AD-201 — How does the driver stamp dates without a date crate? · slice-02 · 2026-10-09

**Chose:** `src/clock.rs`: seconds since the epoch to RFC 3339 and `yyyymmdd` with Howard Hinnant's twelve-line `civil_from_days`, unit-tested on five known instants
**Over:** `chrono` or `time`, a runtime dependency for two format strings
**Because:** the PRD names the run id (`<NNN>-<yyyymmdd>-<4 hex>`) and `ts` on every event but no library (§3, §19 lists the dependencies it minds); the arithmetic is public domain and never changes
**Undo:** replace two functions with `chrono::Utc::now().format(…)` and add the dependency
**Review:** fyi

### AD-202 — How does `find_live` know a pid is alive? · slice-02 · 2026-10-09

**Chose:** read `/proc/<pid>/stat` and treat a missing file, `Z` or `X` as gone
**Over:** `kill(pid, 0)` through `libc` (a dependency for one syscall) or `std::process` (no liveness query)
**Because:** §19 makes the driver Linux-only, and a zombie run process must count as gone or `factory run` would refuse forever
**Undo:** one function, `src/run.rs::pid_alive`
**Review:** no

### AD-203 — Which existing run does `factory run` resume? · slice-02 · 2026-10-09

**Chose:** the newest run for this repo and feature whose phase is not `finished` or `failed`; a terminal run is left alone and a new run is created beside it
**Over:** resuming any existing run dir (a finished run would be reopened and its board re-read with nothing to do), or always creating a new run (the resume of §3 bullet 1 would never happen)
**Because:** task 3 says "an existing run dir → skip preflight, `run_resumed`" without saying which; a terminal run has nothing to resume
**Undo:** `src/run.rs::find_resumable`
**Review:** fyi

### AD-204 — What does an `ask_opened` event carry? · slice-02 · 2026-10-09

**Chose:** `{id: "ASK-n", source: "ask" | "judge", text}` — the tool's line verbatim and where it came from
**Over:** `{id, text}` only, which loses whether `/deliver`'s "proceed as-is" shortcut applies, or one event holding every question, which slice 04 would have to split to answer one
**Because:** §3 says one question each but not the payload; slices 04 and 10 read it, and BLOCK-201 may turn on `source`
**Undo:** one field in `src/events.rs::EventKind::AskOpened` and its readers
**Review:** fyi
